# Plex-TUI
A (Completely Unofficial) Terminal User Interface (TUI) for Plex

This is currently very hacky and very much a work in progress.  I consulted no Plex documentation in using the API; I simply reverse engineered it by trying different URLs.  Additionally, the audio playback is accomplished by piping cURL to FFPlay in a subprocess, which is probably not the best way of doing things.
